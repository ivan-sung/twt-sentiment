**S&P500 Sentiment Analysis using Twitter**

The data used in this project can be downloaded [here](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/stock-market-tweets-data), uploaded to IEEE DataPort by [Bruno Taborda](https://ieee-dataport.org/authors/bruno-taborda).

Originally started as a class project for ECON1680 (Machine Learning, Text Analysis, and Economics) at Brown University. 
The notebook `sentiment-analysis.ipynb` contains code for preprocessing and cleaning the data for text analysis, a comparison between the vectorization methods Word2Vec and TF-IDF, sentiment predictions for each post in the dataset, and a correlation analysis between overall Twitter sentiment for each day and the performance of the S&P500 index.
