The file beginning with `tweets_labelled` contains all of the labeled Twitter posts from the dataset, which is used as the training data. The file beginning with `tweets_remaining` is used as a testing dataset, as well as for the correlation analysis at the end of the project.

The notebook `project2.ipynb` contains the machine learning and text analysis code for the classification task, as well as some visualizations and tables.
